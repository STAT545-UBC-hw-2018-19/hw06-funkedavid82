In this homework, I will be working on two tasks: Task1 is to explore `Character data` by working on the exercises in the [Strings chapter of R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html). Task2 is about working with a list by writing up a lesson from the [purrr tutorial](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/index.html)

To start with, load the necessary R packages as in below.

``` r
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
```

    ## Warning: package 'readr' was built under R version 3.3.2

    ## Warning: package 'purrr' was built under R version 3.3.2

    ## Warning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 3.3.2

``` r
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(stringr))
library(gapminder)
```

    ## Warning: package 'gapminder' was built under R version 3.3.2

``` r
library(testthat)
```

    ## Warning: package 'testthat' was built under R version 3.3.2

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'testthat'

    ## The following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':
    ## 
    ##     matches

    ## The following object is masked from 'package:purrr':

TASK1 :
=======

Resources
---------

This task was done using the following resources:

1.  Mostly [stat545.com: character data](http://stat545.com/block028_character-data.html)
    -   See the ["Resources" section](http://stat545.com/block028_character-data.html#resources) for a more comprehensive listing of resources based on the character problem you're facing.
2.  [Older stat545 notes](http://stat545.com/block022_regular-expression.html)
3.  [r4ds: strings](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html).
4.  [`stringr` vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/vignettes/stringr.html)

The main focus of the Strings chapter is on `regular expressions`, or `regexps` for short. It focuses on `stringr` package for string manipulation. Functions from `stringr` start with `str_`.

14.2.5 Exercises:
-----------------

### 1. In code that doesn’t use stringr, you’ll often see paste() and paste0(). What’s the difference between the two functions? What stringr function are they equivalent to? How do the functions differ in their handling of NA?

``` r
#Differences between paste() and paste0()
paste("This", "is", "a", "string") #it seems like paste() has an in-built separator even without specifying or including sep = " " when trying to concatenate string
```

    ## [1] "This is a string"

``` r
paste("This", "is", "a", "string", sep = " ") #this is equivalent as to when there is no sep.
```

    ## [1] "This is a string"

``` r
paste("This", "is", "a", "string", sep = "") #this is equivalent as to when we have paste0().
```

    ## [1] "Thisisastring"

``` r
paste0("This", "is", "a", "string") #no in-built separator
```

    ## [1] "Thisisastring"

``` r
paste0("This", "is", "a", "string", sep = " ") #no in-built separator and sep = " " is even doing nothing
```

    ## [1] "Thisisastring "

``` r
#The string function they are equivalent to: 

#All these are equivalent.
paste("This", "is", "a", "string", sep = "")
```

    ## [1] "Thisisastring"

``` r
paste0("This", "is", "a", "string")
```

    ## [1] "Thisisastring"

``` r
str_c("This", "is", "a", "string")
```

    ## [1] "Thisisastring"

``` r
str_c("This", "is", "a", "string", sep = "")
```

    ## [1] "Thisisastring"

``` r
#These are also equivalent
paste("This", "is", "a", "string")
```

    ## [1] "This is a string"

``` r
paste("This", "is", "a", "string", sep = " ")
```

    ## [1] "This is a string"

``` r
str_c("This", "is", "a", "string", sep = " ")
```

    ## [1] "This is a string"

``` r
#How the three functions differ in handling of NA
paste("This", "is", "a", "string", NA) #concatenate strings with separator and populate NA as part of a string
```

    ## [1] "This is a string NA"

``` r
paste0("This", "is", "a", "string", NA) #concatenate strings with no separator and populate NA as part of a string
```

    ## [1] "ThisisastringNA"

``` r
str_c("This", "is", "a", "string", NA) # only output NA, no concatenation
```

    ## [1] NA

### 2. In your own words, describe the difference between the `sep` and `collapse arguments` to `str_c()`

``` r
str_c("This", "is", "a", "string", sep = "&") #the words are separated by &
```

    ## [1] "This&is&a&string"

``` r
str_c("This", "is", "a", "string", collapse = "&") #no separation between words
```

    ## [1] "Thisisastring"

``` r
Statement1 <- c("Big", "Small")
Statement2 <- c("Dad", "Mom")
str_c(Statement1, Statement2, sep = ";") #separator appears between each element in a vector 
```

    ## [1] "Big;Dad"   "Small;Mom"

``` r
str_c(Statement1, Statement2, sep = ";", collapse = "&") #separator appears between each element in a vector and then collapse & is used to collapse the concatenated strings of two vectors into a string. 
```

    ## [1] "Big;Dad&Small;Mom"

### 3. Use `str_length()` and `str_sub()` to extract the middle character from a string. What will you do if the string has an even number of characters?

``` r
Statement3 <- "This is a string"
str_length(Statement3) #number of characters/alphabets including spaces in Statement3
```

    ## [1] 16

``` r
str_length(c("a", "R for data science", NA)) #number of characters/alphabets in each words of the string.
```

    ## [1]  1 18 NA

``` r
str_length("science")# scinece contains 7 characters
```

    ## [1] 7

``` r
#For non-even number of character
S <- "science"
str_sub(S, str_length(S)/2 +1, str_length(S)/2 +1) #e appears to be the middle character
```

    ## [1] "e"

``` r
#String with even character?
W <- "scienceworld"
str_sub(W, str_length(W)/2, str_length(W)/2 +1) #ce appears to be the middle 2 characters
```

    ## [1] "ce"

### 4. What does str\_wrap() do? When might you want to use it?

``` r
Paragraph <- "This is a string. Strings can sometimes be separated into words, and sometimes words into characters. It's a lot easier and better to see when we collapse them all"
Paragraph
```

    ## [1] "This is a string. Strings can sometimes be separated into words, and sometimes words into characters. It's a lot easier and better to see when we collapse them all"

``` r
cat(str_wrap(Paragraph)) #str_wrap is used to break long paragraphs/texts into sentences.
```

    ## This is a string. Strings can sometimes be separated into words, and sometimes
    ## words into characters. It's a lot easier and better to see when we collapse them
    ## all

``` r
cat(str_wrap(Paragraph, width = 30), "\n") #here we have specified the desired lenght of the sentences. We can use this to fit into a specified paper or space.
```

    ## This is a string. Strings can
    ## sometimes be separated into
    ## words, and sometimes words
    ## into characters. It's a lot
    ## easier and better to see when
    ## we collapse them all

### 5. What does `str_trim()` do? What’s the opposite of `str_trim()`?

The opposite of `str_trim` is `str_pad` which allows us to add characters, words, spaces as desired.

``` r
#str_trim() removes all spaces in the heading, tailing, before and after a string
Statement4 <- "  This is a string  "
Statement4
```

    ## [1] "  This is a string  "

``` r
str_trim(Statement4) #here the spaces are gone
```

    ## [1] "This is a string"

``` r
(num <- str_pad(1:12, width=3, side = "left", pad = "$")) #make exactly three chracters and added $ to the left of anyone less than 3 to have all lenght exactly 3  
```

    ##  [1] "$$1" "$$2" "$$3" "$$4" "$$5" "$$6" "$$7" "$$8" "$$9" "$10" "$11"
    ## [12] "$12"

### 6. Write a function that turns (e.g.) a vector c("a", "b", "c") into the string a, b, and c. Think carefully about what it should do if given a vector of length 0, 1, or 2.

``` r
Vector_to_String <- function(x) {
  if (length(x) ==0) { #return empty string if length is zero
    return("")
  }
  else if (length(x) == 1) { #return "a" of length is 1
    return(x)
  }
  else if (length(x) == 2) { #return "a and b" if length is 2, 
    return(str_c(x, collapse = " and "))
  }
  else {
    initial <- str_c(x[-length(x)], collapse = " , ")
    final <- str_c(initial, x[length(x)], sep = ", and ") #else return "a, b,...,z"
    return(final)
  }
}
#Check that the function works
Vector_to_String("")
```

    ## [1] ""

``` r
Vector_to_String("a")
```

    ## [1] "a"

``` r
Vector_to_String(c("a", "b"))
```

    ## [1] "a and b"

``` r
Vector_to_String(c("a", "b", "c"))
```

    ## [1] "a , b, and c"

``` r
Vector_to_String(c("a", "b", "c", "d"))
```

    ## [1] "a , b , c, and d"

``` r
#Now test the function with expect_equal
expect_equal(Vector_to_String(c("a", "b")), "a and b")
expect_equal(Vector_to_String(c("a", "b", "c", "d")), "a , b , c, and d")
#No error messages mean they are equal
```
